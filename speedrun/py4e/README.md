## 02 variables

### Some operators

```python
a = 12
b = 10

print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a/b)
print(a*b)
print(a**b)         # exponents
print(a//b)         # floor?

type(a)             # <class 'int'>
c = input("prompt") # assign input to c
```

## 06 Iteration

```python
# infinite input different way
while True:
    line = input("> ")
    if line == 'x':
        break
    print(line)

print("ending")
```

### using `continue`

`continue` is to end the current iteration(care of scope) and jump to the next iteration. 

> often used together with a condition `if` statement to do something special

```python
while True:
    line = input('> ')
    if line[0] == '#':
        continue
    if line == 'done':
        break
    print(line)
print('Done!')
```

## 07 Strings

strings are sequences of chars

```python
a = 'cheese'
a[1]                # 'h'

# string traversal
for x in range(0, len(a)):
    print(letter[x])

for x in a:
    print(x)

# string slicing
a[:2]               # 'che'
a[2:]               # 'ese'

# `in` operator
'a' in 'banana'     # True
'ee' in 'banana'    # False

# str.find
a.find('s')         # 4 index of s
# also have a 2nd int arg to specify where the search start

# strip whitespace
b = '   ol   '
b.strip()           # ol
```

## 08 Files

### Persistence

This chapter cover content on how to work with Secondary Memory(files)

### Opening files

```python
# use try exept in case there is an error finding/openning thefile
try:
    fhand = open('filedir.ext') 
    # frints the handle not the file
    print(fhand)
except:
    print("error")
```

> if `open` is successful, the os returns a **file handle**.
> Which is not the actual data but it can be used to read data.
> the **handle** is only returned if the file exist and given the proper permissions to read the file

### Text files and lines

> stuff about newlines. [read this](https://www.py4e.com/html3/07-files#text-files-and-lines) for more info

### Reading files

while the **handle** doesnt contain file data, its easy to setup a `for` loop to read and count each of the lines in a file

```python
# count number of lines in file
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
count = 0
for line in hand:
    count = count +1
print('Line count:', count)
```

If you know the file size is **smaller** thand thesize of your main memory. You could always use the `read()` methof from the file handler

```python
handler = open('file.txt')
print(handler.read())
```

> its better to store output of `read()` to a var since every call will exhaust the resource

> also `open()` should also be used if the file data fits confortably in the computers main memory

### Searching through a file

Simple, run a foreach loop through the file then use if statements to search for patterns

```python
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
count = 0

for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('From:'):        # search for matching prefix
        print(line)
```

Now when your programs gets more complicated, you may want to use `continue` in the loops.
Basic idea is the loop is looking for specific lines and skipping others.
When the line is **found** do something with it.

```python
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')

for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    # if line starts with from is not true # hmmm
    if not line.startswith('From:'):    
        continue
    # Process our 'interesting' line
    print(line)
```

### Letting the user choose the file name

simply just let the user input the filename

### Using `try`, `exept`, and `open`

### Writing files

to write to files, use `'w'` as a seccond params, but if the file **did not exist**, a new one will be created.

To write, use the `write()` function of the **file handler**, make sure to **manualy** manage `newlines` when writing to file

```python
fout = open('output.txt', 'w')
fout.write("stuff\n")
fout.close()
```

and when youre done writing or using the file handler, **always** remember to `close()` it

```python
fhandler.close()
```

## 09 Lists

like strings(sequence of char), `list` are a sequence of mixed variables(including other lists) enclosed in `[]`

### Traversing a list

```python
# Most common with a for loop
for i in numbers:
    print(i)
# or
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    print(i)
```

### List operations

Possible to:

```python
# add 2 lists together
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
print(a + b)        # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# multiply a list with an int
print([0] * 4)      # [0, 0, 0, 0]
```

### Slice Operators

```python
t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']

t[:4]       # prints 0-4
t[3:]       # prints 3-end
t[1:3]      # prints 1-3

# can also use slice to change values
t[1:4] = ['x', 'y']
## ['a', 'x', 'y', 'f']
```

### List methods

```python
# adds to end of list
t.append('d')
# extends takes a list as an arg and appends all of its elements
t1.extends(t2)
# arrange from low to high
t.sort()
# python uses timsort
```

### Deleting elements

multiple ways of doing this

```python
# removes element at index and return removed element
li.pop(2)               # returns li[2] before removed

# simply remove the value
del li[2]
# remove more than one
del li[2:3]

# knows the elemtn but not the index
li.remove("cheese")
```

### List and functions

List also contains some built in functions to let you quickly look through list without writing loops

```python 
# return length
len(lis)

# returns highest
max(lis)

# returns lowest
min(lis)

# returns total
sum(nums)
```

### Lists and strings

Strings are **sequence of characters**, and lists are sequence of **value**. BUT list of chars are not the same as string.

```python
# split string into list of char
s = "spam"
t = list(s)

# split sentence into list of word
lis = sentence.split()

# use an arg for split() to split to string by specific seperator
lis = sentence.split(',')

# join list of strings
full_sent = " "
full_sent.join(lists)
# this case join all strings in lists seperated by a space
```

### Objects and values

This section talk `very lightly` about assignments, reference, pointers?

```python
a = 'banana'
b = 'banana'

# even though both are of the same string
# a and b referes to different objects
# to check if a and b refer 2 different objects use is operator
a is b

# same - True
# different - False
```

### Aliasing

> Refer to previous section

to use another variable to refer to a specific object, just use assignment

```python
a = [1 ,2, 3]
b = a
b is a          # true

# then b can be used to mutate a
b[0] = 3
print(a)        # [3, 2, 3]
```

### List Args

> Just stuff on good/bad way to use function args

> Also do the exercises and read the debugging section

## 10 Dictionaries

`dictionary` are similar to `list`. BUT in List, each element are identified by an index number.
in Dictionaries, each element are associated wit a **key** value.

> The association of akey and a value is called `key-value` pair or an `item`

All the examples in this sections will be dictionaries of `English : Spanish` words so both keys and values will be strings

```python
# ditct() creates adictionary without items
translate = dict()

# adding an item with a keyhttps://www.twitch.tv/evo
# value is uno
translate['one'] = 'uno'
```

> The item order of a *dict* at creation does *not matter*.
> If you print out the *dict* it will not return the **expected order**. 
> The item order is **unpredictable**

The `in` operator for *dict* will tell you if its a **key** in the dict.
Using values will **return `False`**

```python
'one' in translate      # True
'uni' in translate      # False

# in uses a different algorithm for list and dicts
# List uses a linear search algo    O(n)
# Dict uses a hash table            O(logn)
```

[more on hash tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)

> Write program that reads the word in `word.txt` and store them as keys in a dict and it doesnt matter what the values are
>
> Then use  `in` to check the keys

### Dictionary as a set of counters

Suppose given a string and you want to count how many each letter appears, Theres are several ways to achieve this

> 1. create 26 vars, traverse the string and for each corresponding char, increment the var
> 2. create a list of elem, where each char is correspond with an index number. increment the matching element
> 3. create dict with chars as keys. When first see the word, add in the dict and increment the matching key-char 

From this its clear that using a *dict* will be fastest

This is what it looks like

```python
word = "bird up"
chardict = dict()

for chars in word:
    if c not in chardict:       # not in dict, add with counter 1
        chardict[c] = 1
    else:                       # exist, increment
        chardict[c] = chardict[c] + 1
```

#### `dict.get(key, value)`

`get()` operator takes a key and **default value**. If the key **exist** -> returns the corresponding value. Else returns the **default value**

```python
counts = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'annie' : 42, 'jan': 100}
print(counts.get('jan', 0))         # 100
print(counts.get('tim', 0))         # 0
```

with this we can more precisely write the char count program before. `get` method automaticly handles the case where a key is not a dict.

```python
word = 'bird up'
d = dict()

for chars in word:
    d[chars] = d.get(c, 0) + 1
```

### Dictionaries and files

Anothe use is to count word occurance in text file. Lets try an extraction of *Romeo and Juliet*

```md
But soft what light through yonder window breaks
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
Who is already sick and pale with grief
```

So we need 2 `for` loops (go throuh each line, go through each word)

```python
fhand = open('file.txt')
counts = dict()

for line in fhand:
    words = line.strip().split()
    for word in words:
        counts[word] = counts.get(word, 0) + 1
```

### Looping and Dictionaries

Just some patterns looping through the dict

```python   
# show keys with count > 10
counts = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'annie' : 42, 'jan': 100}
for key in counts:
    if counts[key] > 10 :
        print(key, counts[key])
```

```python
# print alphabetized key
counts = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'annie' : 42, 'jan': 100}
lst = list(counts.keys())
print(lst)
lst.sort()
for key in lst:
    print(key, counts[key])
```

### Advanced text Parsing

so removing punctuation. we can use `lower`, `punctuation`, and `translate`

> translate is pretty weird
>
> `line.translate(str.maketrans(fromstr, tostr, deletestr))`
>
> Replace the characters in `fromstr` with the character in the same position in `tostr` and delete all characters that are in `deletestr`. The `fromstr` and `tostr` can be empty strings and the `deletestr` parameter can be omitted.

we wont specify `tostr` but use `deletestr` params to delete all punctuation.

We get the list of punctuation from python `string.punctiation`

```python
import string

fhand = open("filename")
counts = dict()

for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip().lower()
    line = line.translate(line.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))
    words = line.split()
    for word not in counts:
        counts[word] = 1
    else:
        counts[word] += 1

# care this might be py2.0
