## Part 1 - Learning to program

### Ch1 Intro

#### Installation

- **Installation** pretty self explanatory go [here (windows)](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), download and install the latest python3 version (2 is fine too)
- If you're **stuck** theres a [companion website](https://nostarch.com/pythonforkids) to get all the example in the book + more.
- If all else fails [google](https://www.google.com) is your best friend
- Remember to have fun, experiment.

#### Starting

> If you're stuck/ confused, feel free to ask me and or the internet for help.

- Ill start slow in this chapter to help you get used to the working environment. Then I`ll speed it up in the other chapters.
- Once installed, go ahead and launch the program `IDLE` (should be where you installed Python or search it) and you should see this. (dont worry too much if the version number is different)

```sh
Python 3.8.1 (default, Dec 21 2019, 20:57:38) 
[GCC 9.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

- This is the `Python shell`, it's integrated dev environment, where you can type in python commands to run.
- Lets try using the `print()` command to print out a string

```python
# type this in
print("Hello world")
# once you press ENTER this will be printed under
# Hello world

# The prompt (>>>) will then reappear to let you know the shell is ready to accept more commands.
```

- Make sure you surround `Hello World` correctly with double quotes `"Hello World"`. This is to tell the `print()` command that this is a `string` to print into the shell.
- **YER DID IT** congrats on your first line of code(?). You can try to experiment with the `print()` command, try mess up the spelling of different parts, using numbers, missing `"`

#### Saving your Python Programs

> I wont go through this in detail

1. In `IDLE` Choose `File` > `New Window`, a new empty window will appear with `Utitled` in the menu bar
2. Enter another `print()` command to print something
3. choose `File` > `Save`, save as `hello.py`
4. choose `Run` > `Run Module`

### Ch2 Calculations and variables

> Alot will be skimmed

#### Calculating with python 

Basicly maths, unlike the `print()` statements, which prints out what ever text inside the braces (surrounded by double quotes ofc).

To do maths, you just simply type it out in the promt `>>>` and the result will be printed

| Symbols | Operators |
|---|---|
| `+` | Add |
| `-` | Substraction |
| `*` | Multiplication |
| `/` | Division |

For order of operations use bracket `()`, **NOTE** unlike maths only round brackets are used `()`

> **NOTE** for the coding blocks below, the lines starting with `#` are comments, which the python shell will ignore.
> Comments are just notes you/other people note down to help better explain what the program does

#### Variables

**Variables** in programming describe **objects** which stores information (numbers, text, list of num/text). Have a look at this.

```python
cheese = 100
 
# Here we have a variable name "cheese" assigned with the number 100
# guess what happened when you run this

print(cheese)
```

The **Equal** operator `=` is not the same in mathematics. In programming a single `=` stand for **asign**. Where the value in the RightHandSide(`100`) is **assigned** to the variable in the LeftHandSide(`cheese`)

Now look at this

```python
square = 20
circle = 10
square = circle
print(square)           # what does this print out
                        # ans: 10
```

encorporating with some maths
```python
one = 3
two = 1
five = 6

two + five * (one - 1)  # whats the result of this equation
                        # ans: 1 + 6 * (3 - 1) = 14
```

You can try those out on `IDLE` the python shell, or run [this](./pyforkids/p1/chapt1.py)

### Ch3 Strings, Lists, Tuples and Maps

#### String

In programming, *strings* are what we call *text*, think of it as a collection of letters, numbers and symbols. In chapt 1 we used a string `"Hello World"`

We put double(or single) quotes around the text to tell python/the computer that this is a **string**.

To do multi line strings use tripple single quotes `'''` to open and close the multiline string

```python
poem = '''Roses are red
Violets are blue
Python is weird
And so are you'''

# try print it out to see if it works
```

##### Some problems with strings

There will be problems with strings which uses quotes in it. **Solution** use the 3x single quotes `'''` or **escape character** (look this up), adding a backslash `\` in front of each single/double quotes you wanted to be reprented as a string (`\'` or `\"`)

```python
triple = '''He said, "Aren't can't shouldn't wouldn't". '''
escape = "He said, \"Aren\'t can\'t shouldn\'t wouldn\'t\"."
# both of this are correct
```

##### Embedding values in String

This is to display a message(string) using the contents of a *variable* using `%s`.
It's like a **marker** for where you want to add the value (substitution).

```python
score_1 = 1234
score_2 = 333
message = "Scored %s points"
print(message % score_1)            # Scored 1234 points
print(message % score_2)            # Score 333 points  
```

> The `%s` is a place holder for another value to be embedded into the string.
> the `print(message % score_1)` tells python to 
> 1. prints out message
> 2. replaces the instance of `%s` with the value of the variable `score_1`

This for now only uses 1 variable, what about multiple variables.
Its pretty much **the same**

```python
equation = '%s plus %s equals %s'   # String using 3 variables
num_a = 3
num_b = 2

# Im sure you can work out how this works
print(equation % (num_a, num_b, num_a + num_b))
```

##### Multiplying string

pretty self explanatory, multiply a string by `x` makes the string repeats `x` times

```python
laugh = "hue "
laughing = laugh * 10
print(laughing)

spacing = ' ' * 15
print('%s This is' % spacing)
print('%s In the Middle' % spacing)
```

#### List

Lists are fun, most likely, you'll encounter different types of list in programming

#### Tuples
