## Part 1 - Learning to program

### Ch1 Intro

#### Installation

- **Installation** pretty self explanatory go [here (windows)](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), download and install the latest python3 version (2 is fine too)
- If you're **stuck** theres a [companion website](https://nostarch.com/pythonforkids) to get all the example in the book + more.
- If all else fails [google](https://www.google.com) is your best friend
- Remember to have fun, experiment.

#### Starting

> If you're stuck/ confused, feel free to ask me and or the internet for help.

- Ill start slow in this chapter to help you get used to the working environment. Then I`ll speed it up in the other chapters.
- Once installed, go ahead and launch the program `IDLE` (should be where you installed Python or search it) and you should see this. (dont worry too much if the version number is different)

```sh
Python 3.8.1 (default, Dec 21 2019, 20:57:38) 
[GCC 9.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

- This is the `Python shell`, it's integrated dev environment, where you can type in python commands to run.
- Lets try using the `print()` command to print out a string

```python
# type this in
print("Hello world")
# once you press ENTER this will be printed under
# Hello world

# The prompt (>>>) will then reappear to let you know the shell is ready to accept more commands.
```

- Make sure you surround `Hello World` correctly with double quotes `"Hello World"`. This is to tell the `print()` command that this is a `string` to print into the shell.
- **YER DID IT** congrats on your first line of code(?). You can try to experiment with the `print()` command, try mess up the spelling of different parts, using numbers, missing `"`
