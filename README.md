# learning-py

Truly, I need to stick with 1 - 2 lang if I want to get any where

## Why Python

- I want to learn what the fuss is about.
- Mostly learn to respect the language
  - Didn't like it because of the syntax ( lack of braces for scopes )

## Plan

- Starting out with quickly skimming through 2 books designed for kids (yes)
  - Python for Kids (no starch press)
  - Teach your kids to code with python (no starch press)
- Notes down syntax I dont know, do light simple practice on syntax
- All notes for this part of the **Game Plan** will be stored in the [`speedrun` folder](./speedrun)
