# learning-py

Truly, I need to stick with 1 - 2 lang if I want to get any where

## Why Python

- I want to learn what the fuss is about.
- Mostly learn to respect the language
  - Didn't like it because of the syntax ( lack of braces for scopes )

## Plan

- Complete [python for everyone](https://www.py4e.com) also notes are in the speedrun folder

## Simple stuff

- [py4kids](speedrun/pyforkids/README.md) yes really
- [py4e](speedrun/py4e/README.md)
